Some bugs in the game are more annoying than others. So we decided to take
care of some of the bugs that were good candidates for winning a “most popular
bugs” contest. We are very sorry for closing tickets with a large fan base.
These issues will be missed, but we are relatively sure that their fans will
find other interesting bugs to follow.

We are also getting very close to the first 1.9 pre-release. Please make sure
you vote on the most severe bugs in the bug tracker if you want to make sure
we look at them before releasing 1.9.

Notable changes:

  * Better riding mechanics for boats, horses, minecarts and saddled pigs
  * The elytra texture now defaults to the cape texture if no custom texture is uploaded and the player owns a cape
  * Some sounds are sounding better now
  * Some sounds are sounding different now
  * Most sounds are still sounding exactly as before
  * Most entities in the game should now move much smoother
  * Villagers are not making fun of players anymore when nobody is around

Call it “snapshots” and check the box saying “ _Enable experimental

select it in the dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up
