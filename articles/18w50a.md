# 18w50a
Published on 2018-12-12

It's that time of year again... You know the one, it happens every year in
December and brings a tear to everybody's eye... That's right, it's the last
major snapshot of the year!

Todays snapshot brings us a lot of cool Village related features, and we're
happy to finally get these out to you all before the year's up. We weren't
able to finish everything we wanted, however, so we'll see you again soon in
January with even more Village & Pillage features to help test!

Have a great new year, everybody!
