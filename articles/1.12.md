Sunlight yellow, chili red, royal blue, midnight black, grass green, lilac
purple, true lime, fresh salmon, hot cappuccino, pretty much all of the off-
white, annoying cyan, alpha-tested magenta, that brown-greenish barf shade...
the World of Color update is here! (Minecraft Java Edition 1.12, editor's
note.)

With this update we bring you a fresh take on all the colored blocks in
Minecraft, using the infamous "Jonni Palette 0.2" for wool, sheep, shulker
boxes, and banners, and introducing glazed terracotta, colored beds, and
colored concrete. These bring you many new options to building colorful
creations in your meticulously planned spawn area.

We asked the community to show us what they could do with the new blocks - and
the results were a technicolour triumph! We took some of our favourites and
put them in the trailer below!

The World of Color update also introduces the recipe book and a whole new
advancements system. These will help guiding your way through the adventure of
Minecraft, and can be utilized by creators to make interesting custom
adventure maps and mini games.

And lets not forget, parrots! :partyparrot:
