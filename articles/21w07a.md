# Changes in 21w07a

## World Generation

  * Tweaked huge caves to be more rare and decreased the chance that caves are filled with water
  * Changed ore generation to match the new world height and to add more strategy to mining
  * Tweaked size and positioning of diorite, andesite & granite generation
  * Exception: Diorite and Granite and Dirt no longer generate below y = 0
  * Strongholds are now mostly encased in stone
  * Mineshaft corridors are now supported by log pillars below or chains above when needed

## Visuals

  * Ores without unique shapes have been given new textures for accessibility reasons, so that each ore is distinguishable by shape alone
  * Being the most iconic ore, Diamond Ore texture is staying the same to keep that classic feel maintained
  * Blackstone, Polished Blackstone Bricks, and Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks have had some minor touch ups

    * Openables
