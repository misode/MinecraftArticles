# 16w38a
Published on Sep 20, 2016

It’s snapshot time again!

This snapshot gives you a lot of bug fixes and also a new gamerule! If you are
longing for new features - don’t worry, since MINECON is very close now! And
during MINECON we will give you info about several new exciting 1.11 features!

And this snapshot includes…

_Notable changes:_

  * The poor squids shouldn’t spawn in lava anymore. At least I would not enjoy spawning in lava
  * We have a new gamerule: maxEntityCramming
  * Mooshrooms now really appreciates to walk on mycelium. Probably it feels soft and cosy on their hooves
