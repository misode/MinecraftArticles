  * Allowed the bow to be shot from off-hand.
  * Made chunk generation much smoother in both multiplayer and singleplayer.
  * Added new flatworld preset.
  * Lots of optimisations.
  * Many bug fixes.
  * Cuddling increases happiness by 35%.

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can select it in the
dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up your world first
or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new profile” dialog).

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
