# Changes in 19w38a

  * Fixed a few bugs
  * Some technical changes, listed below

# Technical

Loot table predicates can now be defined in separate files and used for entity
selectors and in execute if command.

  * Added general-purpose storage for data commands.
  * Extended advancement and loot table predicates.
  * Extended schedule command to allow scheduling function multiple times

### Entity Predicate

#### player

Entity predicate now accepts player field, which checks player properties.
Fails when entity is not player.

##### Fields:

  * level \- range of allowed player levels
  * gamemode \- same values as /gamemode command
  * stats \- list of statistics to match. Entry fields: type (like minecraft:custom), stat (like minecraft:sneak_time) and value (int range)
  * recipes \- map of recipe ids. Boolean value tells if it should or should not be known to player
  * advancements \- map of advancement ids. If value is boolean, checks if advancement is done. If value is object, checks completion of criterions.

#### team

Entity predicate now accepts team field, which matches team name.

### Location predicate

#### block and fluid

Predicate also accepts block and fluid sub-predicate. Available fields:

  * block/fluid \- exact block/fluid id to match
  * tag \- block/fluid tag to match
  * nbt \- matcher for block entity NBT (only for blocks)
  * state \- map of name-value properties. Value can be integer, boolean or string or object with optional min and max properties.

#### light

Predicate now accepts light sub-predicate. Object has one integer range -
light that matches visible light (max(sky-darkening,block)).

## Commands

### data

  * Data commands can now use storage as target. This is general-purpose, key-value storage.
    * Storage is shared between all dimensions in level.
    * Data in storage persist between reloads.

### execute if predicate

New subcommand evaluates custom predicates (defined in predicates directory of
datapack).

### schedule

  * Added new syntax /schedule ... [append|replace] (/schedule ... defaults to replace)
  * Added new syntax /schedule clear <id> to remove existing schedules (returns number of removed schedules)

### Entity selectors

New selector parameter predicate allows to apply custom custom predicate
(defined in predicates directory of datapack).

### kill

The kill command now defaults to @s if no target argument is given.

## Custom predicates

Condition part of loot tables can now be defined as separate data pack
resource in predicates directory.

## Loot tables

### location_check

New parameters added:

  * offsetX, offsetY, offsetZ \- optional offsets to location

### time_check condition

New condition that checks day time.

#### Parameters

  * value \- range of accepted values
  * period \- if present, time will be modulo-divided by this value (for example, if set to 24000, value will operate on time of day)

### New conditions

#### reference

Includes condition defined in predicates directory of datapack, selected with
name parameter.
