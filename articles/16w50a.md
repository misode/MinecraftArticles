# 16w50a
Published on 2016-12-15

We are happy to introduce the first (and final?) snapshot of Minecraft
1.11.1!!!!11oneone! This patch is mainly focused on fixing more bugs, but also
contains a number of minor features just in time for the Holidays. In
particular, there is a new use for the fireworks, but remember to be careful
when handling explosives.

There is also a new (potentially controversial) change to the combat
mechanics. Without revealing what it is, you will most definitely notice the
difference when you try out the snapshot. We anticipate much feedback.

Continuing on the combat system, there is a new sword enchantment, and Mending
is no longer compatible with Infinity on bows.

And finally, you can now recycle many tools and items in the furnace. The
reward is minuscule but considerably better than nothing!
