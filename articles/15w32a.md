**Snapshot 15w32a:**

Another week, another snapshot. We are currently focusing on getting all the
new content that we have planned into the snapshots, but it will take a little
time until we see it all there. This week we have spent some time laying down
the ground work for better boss fight AI and upgrade paths between worlds, so
we can do even cooler stuff in the following weeks’ snapshots.

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs for the snapshots last week. We were very
eager to see how many problems are reported for the first snapshots in many
months and we are positively surprised by the fact that we saw less problems
than expected.

Here are some of the improvements since last week:

  * Improved Ender Dragon fight, now with more cowbell!
  * Better handling of using items in both the mainhand and offhand.
  * Some monsters have problems with their vision now, but we don’t have the time to code glasses for them.
  * Generic upgrade path for world saves, this is very technical internal stuff that you’ll only notice if it goes wrong, but it makes our lives easy.
  * Added a thing to the system with the values. Can’t be more specific, no spoilers.

And some bug fixes:

  * [Bug [MC-48730](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-48730)] - Nametags still show while player is invisible and on team
  * [Bug [MC-82833](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-82833)] - Shulker projectile follows player in spectator mode and creative mode
  * [Bug [MC-84035](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-84035)] - Enderdragon can’t die unless perched on portal
  * [Bug [MC-84078](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-84078)] - When fishing rod is cast, all fishing rods look like it was cast out to sea too
  * [Bug [MC-84253](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-84253)] - almost all potion and tipped arrows are black
  * [Bug [MC-84584](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-84584)] - Placing End Rod on End Rod sends “hslsdjfksdlk” to output log twice

A note for everybody else: Back up your world before updating. Things will
break, especially in such an early snapshot. Backup your world. Back it up. Do
it now.

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
