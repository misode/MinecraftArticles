# 1.16.4-pre2
Published on 2020-10-22

Time for another pre-release! This time around we've fixed some issues with
the new social interactions screen, as well as some crashes.

In case you haven't heard, yesterday we announced that Mojang accounts will be
migrating into Microsoft accounts. With this pre-release, we are preparing for
that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft
accounts. You can read more about that over [here](/article/java-edition-
moving-house.html), and you can find answers to questions you might have in
the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360050865492). The FAQ will
be continuously updated.

We aim to release 1.16.4 sometime during next week.
