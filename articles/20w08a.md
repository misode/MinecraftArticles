# 20w08a
Published on 2020-02-19

A wild snapshot appears! To tell you the truth, we hadn't actually planned to
do a snapshot this week, but the Villagers were in dire need of neurosurgery.

# Fixed bug in 20w08a

  * [MC-172078](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-172078) \- All villagers with saved memory disappear when upgrading to 20w07a

# Get the snapshot

Snapshots are available for Minecraft: Java Edition. To install the snapshot,
open up the [Minecraft Launcher](/download.html) and enable snapshots in the
"Installations" tab.

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, so please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
