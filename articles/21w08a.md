## Deepslate

  * Grimstone is now called Deepslate
  * Deepslate now has a top texture, and a new block called Cobbled Deepslate drops from Deepslate
  * The cobbled variant is the same but without the top texture, and is used to craft all Deepslate variants instead
  * Deepslate now has a unique set of sounds! Very crunchy indeed

## Deepslate ores

  * Added Deepslate versions of Iron, Gold, Lapis, Redstone, and Diamond ores that generate wherever those ores replace Deepslate
  * Twice as tough to mine as normal ores

## Ore Distribution Tweaks
