To get pre-releases, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button.
Call it “pre-releases” and check the box saying “Enable experimental
development snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can
select it in the dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up
your world first or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new
profile” dialog).
