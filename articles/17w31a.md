We're all working very hard on 1.13, which will be a technical update to make
the game run better than ever & easier for us to add super cool things later.
But for now, we decided to create a small bugfix release for a security issue
in 1.12.

If this pre-release goes well, we will **release 1.12.1 tomorrow** (Thursday,
3rd of August).

### Changes in pre-release 1.12.1-pre1

  * Minor optimisations
  * Fixed bug [MC-86016](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-86016) \- Some Mojang staff not mentioned in credits.txt
  * Fixed bug [MC-119840](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-119840) \- Diamonds get moved into crafting slots on any chat message

### Changes in snapshot 17w31a

  * Updated game credits
  * Fixed private bug [MC-119011](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-119011) \- Security issue with recipe book

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa). If nobody
reports a bug, we can't fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and go to the "launch options" tab. Check
the box saying _" Enable snapshots"_ and save. To switch between the snapshot
and normal version, you can find a new dropdow menu next to the "Play" button.
Back up your world first or run the game on in a different folder (In the
"launch options" page).

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
