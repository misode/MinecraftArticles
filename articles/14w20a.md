# 14w20a
Published on May 15, 2014

**Update:** Snapshot 14w20b has been released to fix mobs not spawning
naturally.

This weeks snapshot brings many bugfixing, a little polishing and possibly
even some hugs. Maybe. If you’ve been good.

Notable changes:

  * Caves now generate in deserts & mesas.
  * Added new /title command for ingame adventure-map chaptering.
  * Made tab-list more consistent and a little prettier when using health display objective.
  * Adjusting fly speed of spectator mode now works vertically too.
  * If you’re stuck outside the world border, you can now walk freely to go back inside.
  * Bunch of bugs fixed!
  * Removed the 4th dimension from blocks. This will be a mistake and we were sorry for any inconvenience it will not cause you.
