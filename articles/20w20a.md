This week we are releasing a bit of a smaller snapshot. However, if you're

# Fixed bug in 20w20b

# New Features in in 20w20a

## Game Mode Switcher

New F3 debug feature which allows you to switch game modes with traditional
"tabbing" functionality.

  * Hold F3 and tap F4 to open the menu
  * Tapping F4 will cycle the game mode, or you can use the mouse
  * Release F3 to apply
  * Your last game mode is remembered and will be the first selected option, so you can quickly toggle between two game modes with a single press of F3 + F4!

### F3 + N (Toggle Spectator)

A small change has been made to this debug combination.

  * By default, using this key would return to Creative after toggling from Spectator. It now will toggle back to the previous game mode you had
