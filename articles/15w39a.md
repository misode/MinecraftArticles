# 15w39a
Published on Sep 21, 2015

**Update:** We’ve released 15w39c. Redstone contraptions should visually
update much faster again, and performance should be better on older computers.

**Update:** We’ve released 15w39b. Buckets am became Death, destroyer of
blocks.

The Minecraft team are out for a company workshop, but I’ve decided to stay
behind, hold the fort and man the guns. Ain’t no bugs getting past me!

This means I’m all alone. I can do anything I want. Creepers? They’re upside
down now. Stairs? They’re sideways… and upside down. I added dirtbikes,
removed blocks, and inverted the nether. And nobody can stop me!

Okay maybe not.

  * Found a big cause of FPS loss from 1.8, and hopefully fixed it.

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can select it in the
dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up your world first
or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new profile” dialog).

different folder from your main worlds.**
