**UPDATE:** Minecraft 1.9 Pre-Release 2 is now available.

It is time to stop waiting and start playing. A pre-release of Minecraft 1.9
is now available. We are very excited to enter the final stage before the new
version is released.

First the answer to the most asked question: We are currently planning to
release the final version of Minecraft 1.9 next week, on Thursday, 25th of
February 2016. ( **UPDATE:** the release date was moved to Monday, 29th of
February 2016)

And now to the usual release notes. Once we release the final Minecraft 1.9
update, we will also provide a complete list of changes between Minecraft 1.8
and Minecraft 1.9.

Version 1.9-pre4 only fixes some minor issues that were not reported to the
bugtracker, so we don’t have a list here. According to the commit log, these
issues were touched:

  * Player entities ticking twice on servers

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get snapshots (or, in this case, the pre-release), open your launcher and
press the “ _New Profile_ ” button. Call it “snapshots” and check the box
saying “ _Enable experimental development snapshots_ ” and save. To switch to
the normal version, you can select it in the dropdown at the bottom left
corner of the launcher. Back up your world first or run the game on in a
different folder (See the “new profile” dialog).

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
