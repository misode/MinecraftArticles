# 20w10a
Published on 2020-03-04

Today's snapshot is loud! It comes with a bunch of new ambient sound that adds
some really nice flavour to the Nether biomes. Apart from this, you now have
to use the smithing table to craft Netherite. Happy mining!

# New Features in 20w10a  

  * Added crimson and warped hyphae – all-sided "stem" blocks including stripped variations

# Changes in 20w10a

  * Fish now despawn when further than 64 blocks away from the closest player
  * Hoes are now more like other tools used to break blocks
  * Updated the Netherite item textures
  * Bartering loot has been tweaked once again to bring back Soul Sand, make Netherite Hoes less common, and remove/add items to better fit survival players

## Hoe Changes

We've made some changes to Hoes to make them more useful in the Nether.

  * Each tier has different speed at which Hoes mine blocks they are effective against

## New tags for item frames

  * Invisible \- makes item frame invisible (item inside frame remains visible)
  * Fixed \- prevents item frame from being broken and the item inside from being removed

## target_hit advancement trigger type
