#  /bossbar

This command allows you to create a custom boss bar, change how it looks, and
choose who to show it to.

To create a bossbar called foo:bar, use /bossbar create foo:bar "Name of my
boss bar".

Then change how it looks using the following commands:

  * /bossbar set foo:bar name <name> to change the name (for example "New Name" or {"translate": "entity.minecraft.ender_dragon"})
  * /bossbar set foo:bar color <color> to change the color (for example red, default white)
  * /bossbar set foo:bar style <style> to change the style (for example notched_6, default progress)
  * /bossbar set foo:bar value <value> to change the value (for example 10, default 0)
  * /bossbar set foo:bar max <max> to change the max value (for example 100, default 100)
  * /bossbar set foo:bar visible <visible> to change the visibility (for example false, default true)
  * /bossbar set foo:bar players <players> to change who can see it (for example @a, default none)

You can also store things into bossbars using /execute store (result|success)
bossbar foo:bar (value|max) ...

To remove a bossbar, use /bossbar remove foo:bar.

Bossbars persist across restarts and leaving/rejoining the world. If a player
is added to a boss bar and reconnects, they will be re-added to the bossbar
unless a new set .. players is ran without them in it.
