# 17w47a
Published on 2017-11-22

This weeks snapshot brings us the long awaited "flattening", which will
absolutely break everything. Sorry. Make backups.

#  Changes in 17w47a

  * Implemented command suggestions for blocks and item arguments
  * May have broke everything
  * Added an option (in Chat Settings) to toggle automatic command suggestions (defaults on, otherwise hit tab to bring them up)
  * Most likely broke everything
  * Removed the concept "block data" and "item data", completely and totally
  * Definitely broke everything
  * Split up and renamed almost every block and item
  * Absolutely broke everything
  * Added the ability for us to add new blocks in the future again! Hurrah!
  * There's new blocks, but I want to just emphasize that **everything will probably be broken** and to go make backups instead of focusing on new stuff

#  A warning

This snapshot should be considered "extremely, extremely experimental". From a
scale of 1-10 where 1 is experimental and 10 is stable, this is a very firm
negative 5.

Back up your worlds before trying them in this snapshot. Don't expect worlds
played in this snapshot to work in future snapshots.

#  But seriously

This snapshot represents a few years worth of internal refactoring to allow us
to have virtually unlimited block & item IDs. But we fully expect everything
to break. Please make backups.

#  Resource packs?

Are all broken by this too, sorry.

#  Install the snapshot

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can't
fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and go to the "launch options" tab. Check
the box saying _" Enable snapshots"_ and save. To switch between the snapshot
and normal version, you can find a new dropdow menu next to the "Play" button.
Back up your world first or run the game on in a different folder (In the
"launch options" page).

 **Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
