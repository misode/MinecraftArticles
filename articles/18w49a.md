# 18w49a
Published on 2018-12-05

Another week, another snapshot! Winter is getting closer and it's getting so
cold here in Stockholm that my fingers froze and snapped off while I was
writing this intro (true story).

Anyway, what better way to get into a festive mood than hanging out in a fancy
new village in a snowy biome? If you're not into the whole being cold and
wearing thick woollen socks in the horrible outdoors thing, you can always
stay inside playing Minecraft and hang out in the new updated savanna
villages. If you're hungry, grab some berries! Enjoy!

#  Changes in 18w49a

  * Updated savanna villages
  * Added snowy villages
  * Added Berry Bushes
  * Added Berries
  * Changes to raids
  * New loot table function: copy_nbt

##  Berries

  * Delicious!
  * Not very filling!
  * Plant your berries in the ground and look with your special eyes as they grow up into a strong, independent bush!

##  Berry Bushes

  * Commonly found in Taiga, Taiga Hills, and Taiga Mountains
  * Rarely found in Snowy Taiga and Snowy Taiga Hills and Snowy Taiga Mountains
  * You can stand inside them, but be careful, it will hurt to move
  * Has 4 stages of growth. Sapling, no berries, some berries, full berries
  * Drops 1-2 berries in younger stage, 2-3 in full growth stage
  * Supports bonemeal!

##  Raid changes

  * There's now two waves per Bad Omen level
  * Beast now has a possibility to be a part of every wave
  * You now have to complete a wave before the next one starts

##  New loot table function copy_nbt

  * Copies NBT from source to item tags.

###  Parameters

  * source \- may be this, killer, killer_player or block_entity
  * ops \- list of copy operations:
    * source \- source path (same as /data commands)
    * target \- target path
    * op \- replace, append (for lists), merge \- for compound tags
  * entity \- source of profile (see note about entity target parameter for values, will do nothing if it's not player).
