# 14w19a
Published on May 8, 2014

This weeks snapshot is fairly small in the scheme of things as we’ve been
focusing on optimizations and furthering spectator mode.

Notable changes:

  * World border received a bunch of new options & improvements.
  * Spectator mode has a preliminary interface for teleporting to other players. It’s far from complete though!
  * Loose change.

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can select it in the
dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up your world first
or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new profile” dialog).

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
