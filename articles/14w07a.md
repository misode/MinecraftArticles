# 14w07a
Published on Feb 14, 2014

We’ve still been working hard on rewriting internal stuff (such as how blocks
are rendered, or how the entire inventory system works) in preparation for the
Plugin API. Meanwhile, have another smaller snapshot with a bunch of bug fixes
and some more adventure map related stuffs!

Notable changes for everybody:

  * Added iron trapdoors
  * You can now share to lan for spectator mode only

Notable changes for mapmakers:

  * A resourcepack can now be bundled with a map, put it in the map save directory and name it “resources.zip” 
    * Example: `".minecraft/saves/TheMapWithTheThing/resources.zip"`
  * The commands /testfor, /testforblock and /clear can now test for partial matches of NBT lists 
    * Example: `/testfor @p {Inventory:[{Slot:6b,id:"minecraft:diamond_sword"}],SelectedItemSlot:6}`
  * Scoreboard objectives for fake players with a name starting with # will never show up on the sidebar
  * New /scoreboard subcommands /scoreboard operation and /scoreboard test
  * The command /scoreboard operation can apply arithmetic operation to scores (+ - * / %) and accumulate player scores 
    * Example: `/scoreboard players operation #teamscores redScore += @a[team=red] blueKills`
  * The command /scoreboard test can be used to test if a scoreboard value is between a min and a max value 
    * Example: `/scoreboard players test #global anObjective 12 19`
  * New command /execute to execute commands in the context and at the position of other entities or players 
    * Example: `/execute @e[type=Chicken] ~ ~ ~ fill ~-1 ~-1 ~-1 ~1 ~1 ~1 minecraft:glass`
  * New selector parameters for entity selectors to detect entity rotations with rxm - x rot min, rx - x rot max, rym - y rot min, ry . y rot max 
    * Example: `@a[rxm=-15,rx=15,rym=-45,ry=45]`
  * Players in team can now have a team based objective shown on the sidebar, depending on the team color 
    * Example: `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay team.yellow anotherObjective`
  * While debug overlay is on (press F3 to turn it on and off), looking at a block in the world will show the coordinates of that block
  * BlockItem instances can now hold a custom NBT tag that is merged into a block entity when it’s placed 
    * Example: `/give @p command_block 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Command:"setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:diamond_block"}}`
  * In creative mode, players can create a copy of a BlockEntity in their hotbar, including all NBT data, with ctrl+[PICK_KEY] (usually ctrl+middle mouse button)
  * The /tellraw command can now insert values from scoreboards into messages 
    * Example: `/tellraw @p {text:"Have ",extra:[{score:{name:"Searge",objective:"reward"}},{text:" diamonds"}]}`
  * New command /testforblocks to compare two areas of a map 
    * Example: `/testforblocks 100 64 100 107 69 107 0 64 0 masked`
  * Dispensers will place a commandblock instead of shooting it out
  * Nametags for players in other teams can now be hidden with a team option 
    * Example: `/scoreboard teams option red nametagVisibility hideForOtherTeam`
