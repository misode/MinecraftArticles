# 14w29a
Published on Jul 16, 2014

**Update:** We can never be sure if bending space around time is the right
approach until we get feedback from you on the 14w29b snapshot that bends time
around space instead. We do that by using the newly implemented threaded
render batch system. That’s a lot a fancy sounding words, so if you don’t know
what that means, it should improve performance even more. Or crash horribly.
But without your feedback, we’ll never know which one is true.

So here it is, the 14w29b update…

**Fixed in this snapshot:**

  * [Bug [MC-62116](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-62116)] - Players loses CommandStats{} after Death
  * [Bug [MC-62134](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-62134)] - #players are taking up space on the sidebar display

— 14w29a update notes —

This snapshot contains a lot of optimizations specifically targeting render
performance. If your system supports it, you can select VBO in the video
setting. This enables Vertex Buffer Objects and should increase your fps by 5%
to 10% on average. We are especially interested on feedback on performance
related issues with this snapshot.

Last week we compressed time and space, that did not work too well for the
snapshot. So this week we will try something else and bend space around time.
Apart from these highly experimental changes, we also did this:

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can select it in the
dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up your world first
or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new profile” dialog).

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
