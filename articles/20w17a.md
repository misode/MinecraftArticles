# 20w17a
Published on 2020-04-22

This week's snapshot brings you some tweaks, bugfixes, and technical changes!

We also have a survey up so that you can tell us what you think about the
Nether Update. You can find it by clicking
[here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SF65G2F). We would very much appreciate
if you could take the time and fill it out.

# New Features in 20w17a  

  * Added an Entity Distance scale option ranging from 50% to 500%
  * Difficulty and game rules can now be changed from "Create World" screen

# Changes in 20w17a  

  * Improved Smithing Table UI
  * Ruined Portals now spawn less frequently
  * Renamed "Soul Fire Torch" and "Soul Fire Lantern" to "Soul Torch" and "Soul Lantern"
  * Tweaked Bastion Remnant loot
  * Walls now create posts under more things, like pressure plates and banners
  * The "Singleplayer" button will jump directly to "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select

# Technical Changes in 20w17a

  * Chat component style can now select font
  * Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc)
  * Full range of Unicode characters is supported (some may know what that means 😉)
  * Added the attribute command  

## World save format

  * Saving level.dat now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using level.dat_new every time)
  * player/*.dat are now saved in a way similar to level.dat (including leaving .dat_old files)

## Block storage

BlockStates in Sections elements no longer contain values stretching over
multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e.
single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not
be used.

For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every
64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size
(in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

## Commands

### attribute

Adds modifies attribute on single entity. Possible syntax:  
Parameters:

  * attribute <target> <attribute> get [<scale>] \- get total value of attribute
  * attribute <target> <attribute> base set <value> \- sets base valye
  * attribute <target> <attribute> base get [<scale>] \- get base value
  * attribute <target> <attribute> modifier add <uuid> <name> <value> add|multiply|multiply_base \- adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
  * attribute <target> <attribute> modifier remove <uuid> \- removes modifier
  * attribute <target> <attribute> modifier value get <uuid> [<scale>] \- get value of modifier
  * target \- single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
  * attribute \- name of attribute (like minecraft:generic.max_health)
  * name \- string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
  * value \- floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so your change might not be noticeable)

## Chat components

### Hover event argument

  * style.hoverEvent parameter now has parameter contents, with contents depending on type:
  * For show_text \- chat component
  * For show_item \- either item id or object with fields id, count and tag (with last one being serialized NBT)
  * For show_entity \- object with fields: id (UUID), name (chat component) and type (entity type resource location)
  * Old style value argument is now deprecated (but still supported)

### Colors

color property can now contain RGB value prefixed by #. For example #55ff55
will result in the same color as green.

### Custom fonts

Chat component style now supports font property, which is resource location
for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to minecraft:default.

## Fonts

  * Force Unicode option now switches between normal and alternative font (called uniform.json) - no reload needed
