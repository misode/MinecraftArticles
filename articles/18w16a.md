# 18w16a
Published on 2018-04-19

We're very close to feature complete, and have now started focusing more on
bug fixing & polishing!

#  Changes in 18w16a

  * New custom world type: Buffet
  * Coral fans now generate naturally
  * Drowned can sometimes be found inside ruins
  * Turtle helmet will no longer give you particle effects
  * Turtle helmet will no longer make you absolutely completely 100% invulnerable
  * Blue ice is now ever-so-slightly less slippery than before. Still pretty slippery!
  * When water spreads and would later turn into a source block, it now immediately just places a source block
  * We changed how we calculate the temperature of ocean biomes, which should result in nicer transitions between oceans
  * Mining coral blocks now requires silk touch
  * Changed particle effect from the Conduit
  * Optimized spawn position finding code
  * Technical: there's now a distinction between scheduled "liquid ticks" and "block ticks"
  * Technical: there's new block & item tags for coral
  * Lots of bug fixes!

##  Buffet worlds

All you can pick!

  * As a popular request, we readded a way to play with single biome worlds
  * You can check it out when creating a new world by selecting Buffet World as a world type
  * As a side bonus, we also threw in another way to generate chunks in there
  * Keep an eye on this screen, there might be more things on their way!
  * (it's pretty crazy)
