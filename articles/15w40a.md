# 15w40a
Published on Sep 30, 2015

**UPDATE: Version 15w40b is now available and it fixes the problem that it
wasn’t possible to connect to servers.**

This weeks snapshot brings some further changes to mob AI. We’ve sprayed every
single cactus with animal repellant and hopefully this should keep your pets
out of danger just a little bit longer.

I’ve also been working on boats, but that’s not ready yet!

Notable changes:

  * Lots of changes to mob pathfinding.
  * Changes to how health regenerates.
  * Some bug fixes.
  * Some optimisations.
  * Some hugs.
  * Some bugs.

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can select it in the
dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up your world first
or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new profile” dialog).

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
