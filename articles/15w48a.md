_Snapshot **15w47c** is now available. In your launcher. Right there. Yes,
where it said 15w47b yesterday._

_Snapshot **15w47b** is now available and fixes some issues that made
yesterdays snapshot seem haunted._

_15w47a release notes:_

Snapshot. Time. Again. Yay!

Our issue tracker is now the home page in our browsers and we are going to
keep it that way until Minecraft 1.9 is ready for release. We want to say
“thank you” to everyone who’s reporting issues and voting on them. And of
course we also want to thank our moderators helping us to focus on the
important tickets, they are doing an awesome job to keep the issues under
control.

Due to some complaints that we were too focused on fixing bugs and not adding
more features for 1.9, this weeks snapshot will focus on solving issues
instead.
