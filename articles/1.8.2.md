update to Minecraft 1.8.3**

Finally, after many weeks of development and seven pre-releases, Minecraft
1.8.2 is ready for release. It is now available in the Minecraft launcher and
the server can be downloaded from [the Minecraft website download
page](https://minecraft.net/download).

Only minor changes were made since pre-release 7 which was available since
Monday. Version 1.8.2 is also fully compatible with all previous server
versions (1.8 and 1.8.1), but we recommend to update to 1.8.2 as soon as
possible to benefit from all bug fixes and improvements we made in the game.
