Published on 2018-02-14

Today is Valentines Day! We couldn't think of any better way to show our love
for you than to give you a snapshot full of new things. <3

#  Changes in 18w07a

  * Added Phantoms (MineCon voted mob!)
  * Added Turtles
  * Added new swimming ability (sprint underwater!)
  * Added bubble columns
  * Added ability to strip logs
  * Added new trident weapon
  * Squids now shoot ink to defend themselves
  * Added new kelp and sea grass blocks
  * Items in water now float to the top
  * Added new prismarine stairs and slabs

#  Changes in 18w07b

  * Oxygen no longer regenerates instantly out of water
  * Renamed "Turtle shell piece" to "Scute"
  * Dried kelp block now burn in the world
  * Kelp and sea grass should act a bit more like water
  * Lots of bug fixes. You can craft again!

#  Changes in 18w07c

  * The game shouldn't crash when opening your inventory!

##  Phantoms

You look tired. When's the last time you got a decent night's rest? Bad things
happen to those who don't sleep... they start to hallucinate, and see what's
_really_ there.

  * Spawns in the overworld and the end
  * Attacks players who haven't slept in a while
  * Drops leather, but this may change

##  Turtles

The turtle moves.

  * Spawns on warm beaches, but this is temporary
  * Will lay eggs in their home beach
  * You can craft pieces of their old shell into one big shell
    * And wear it on your head!
    * Or craft it into a potion!
    * Turtles are known for their strength, not their speed
  * Please be kind to turtles. They hold up the world.

##  Kelp and Seagrass

The green in the blue!

  * Seagrass generates in all oceans, but this is temporary
  * Kelp doesn't generate in deep oceans, but this is temporary
  * Kelp can be smelted to get dry kelp
    * A tasty snack for the ocean adventurer!
    * Or a convenient way to fuel more smelting
    * Or just store it away into a dried kelp block

##  Bubble columns

Blub blub blub blub.

  * Doesn't generate anywhere currently
  * Occurs when a magma block is in water
  * Watch out, you'll get sucked under!
  * A good way to breath without cheating game mechanics ;)

##  Stripped logs

Go ahead, axe us a question.

  * You can strip logs by using an axe on them (right-click)
  * Stripped logs act like regular logs in furnaces, crafting, etc
  * They look neat!

##  Tridents

Some say that throwing your only weapon away is a bad idea. We disagree.

  * Right click to throw the trident
  * Left click to melee
  * Currently unobtainable in survival, that will change
  * Super overpowered, we'll balance them later
  * Has 4 available enchantments
    * Loyalty: Your trident will come back to you. Spoil-sport.
    * Impaling: Very useful against creatures of the sea.
    * Riptide: Gotta go fast.
    * Channeling: We're not sure. It's pretty spooky.
  * UI icon is not yet implemented
