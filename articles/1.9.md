# 1.9
Published on Feb 29, 2016

The arrow struck the shield with a impactful “thud!”. Steve peeked around the
shield’s edge and saw the arrow was wrapped in a note! Steve excitedly pulled
it loose to see what it said…

“You’re happy you had that shield, aren’t you?”

And yes, Steve was pretty happy.
