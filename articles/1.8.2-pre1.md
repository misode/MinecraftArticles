Just in time before the holidays, we have the pre-release for 1.8.2 ready.

As always, there are some bugs fixed:

  * [Bug [MC-51573](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-51573)] - Hostile mobs continue to follow/attack you in spectator mode
  * [Bug [MC-65697](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-65697)] - Explosion force on entities is directionally biased

The Minecraft team and everybody else at Mojang wish you happy holidays and a
great transition into the new year!

To get pre-releases, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button.
Call it “pre-releases” and check the box saying “Enable experimental
development snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can
select it in the dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up
your world first or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new
profile” dialog).
