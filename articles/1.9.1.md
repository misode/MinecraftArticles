# 1.9.1
Published on Mar 30, 2016

**Update:** Minecraft 1.9.2 is now available and fixed the issue that some
players could not connect to some servers or their realms.

_1.9.1 notes:_

Woooosh. That’s the sound of the elytra and the main feature of the 1.9.1
release of Minecraft. The second notable change is a new property (toughness)
for armor that “ _makes diamond armor useful again_ ”.

Apart from these awesome additions, we also fixed some reported bugs and
improved the performance and memory usage of servers a bit. Command blocks in
custom maps should also behave much better now, especially with long sequences
that are executed every tick.

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

Notable changes:

  * Added Elytra sound effects
  * Improved AI
  * Improved entity selectors
  * Loot tables now also work in dispensers and droppers
  * Hoppers can now pull items out of blocked chests
  * Increased limit for “executed command blocks per tick”
