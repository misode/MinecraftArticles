# 16w07a
Published on Feb 15, 2016

**UPDATE:** Snapshot 16w07b is now available.

A snapshot on a Monday? How is that possible? We could just pretend it’s
Wednesday, or explain what’s going on. So, here we go:

It’s actually Wednesday, so all is good…

…just kidding. It’s not Wednesday and here’s the real reason:

As we get closer to the first pre-release for Minecraft 1.9, we will release
snapshots more frequently to get more feedback on our changes and bug fixes.
In this phase of development all the bug reports and feedback on Reddit or via
Twitter are helping us a lot to work on the right issues to get to a stable
release.

Notable changes:

  * Bugs fixed
  * Removed the cages that were protecting the crystals during the dragon fight
  * Treat every day as if it’s Wednesday internally

fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “ _New Profile_ ” button.
Call it “snapshots” and check the box saying “ _Enable experimental
development snapshots_ ” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can
select it in the dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up
your world first or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new
