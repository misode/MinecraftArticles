Published on Jan 28, 2016

Yet another week has passed, lots of bugs have been inspected, turned around
and hopefully fixed. We’re inching ever closer to 1.9 and our focus is on
stability, performance and the remaining polish.

This week’s snapshot is all about boats! We did another iteration on them so
please have a swim with them (watch it, they can sink!).

As always we’d like to thank everyone who is reporting bugs, testing the
snapshots and sending us feedback on our changes. While we get closer to 1.9
this will become more and more important. Please continue doing it and thanks
to you all!

Notable changes:

  * Boats are 7% moar boatier.
  * Boats.
  * Boats can sink.
  * Boats > lily pads.
  * Did someone mention boats?
  * Updated sounds, try standing in the rain!
