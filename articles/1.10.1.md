# 1.10.1
Published on Jun 22, 2016

**Update: Version 1.10.2 is now available and fixes the crashes that many
players experienced in Minecraft 1.10.1.**

This is a smaller update taking care of some of the most annoying reported
bugs. We are also planning to release another update for 1.10.x in a few weeks
that takes care of some less critical but still annoying issues.

Issues fixed in version 1.10.2:

  * [Bug [MC-103981](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-103981)] - Missing BlockEntity (Piston_Extension, …)

Issues fixed in version 1.10.1:

  * [Bug [MC-85162](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-85162)] - Slight player/mob offset when on Farmland Block
  * [Bug [MC-99914](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-99914)] - DataWatcher / EntityMetadata ID is based on the class load order
  * [Bug [MC-100333](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-100333)] - Entities from old (<= 1.5.2) worlds are killed when loaded in current versions due to a typo in the health data fixer
  * [Bug [MC-102072](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-102072)] - Structure Block: Unable to navigate in the “structure name” field of structure blocks, using the arrow-keys, pos1, end or the delete key
  * [Bug [MC-102867](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-102867)] - chat key bound to unicode char causes crash in creative inventory
  * [Bug [MC-103177](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-103177)] - Missing subtitles for polar bears, strays, husks, and wither skeletons

To read more about the cool new features in Minecraft 1.10, you can see them
all on [the 1.10 release blog
post](http://mojang.com/2016/06/minecraft-110-an-update-of-fire-and-ice/).

If you experience crashes during multiplayer sessions, we need to know if you
were playing on a vanilla server or a modified server. We still get crash
reports in our backend systems that we can’t reproduce and we need more
information to analyze that problem. It seems to be a rare but annoying
problem for some players.
