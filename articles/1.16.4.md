# 1.16.4
Published on 2020-11-03

It's time for the 1.16.4 release! This release adds the new social
interactions screen and fixes a few crashes.

If you missed it, we recently announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating
into Microsoft accounts. This release prepares for that by having the game
understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read
more about it over [here](/article/java-edition-moving-house.html), and you
can find answers to questions you might have in the
[FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492), which will
be continuously updated.  

# Features

## Blocked Players

  * When logging in with a Microsoft account, players blocked in your account are now also blocked in the game, and account restrictions are now respected
