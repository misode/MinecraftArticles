##  Fox

What do they say?

  * Foxes are nocturnal
  * Foxes are nimble and quick, so sneak up on them carefully!
  * Breed foxes with berries
  * If you breed two foxes, their offspring will trust you forever
  * Foxes like to eat any and every food item they find on the ground
  * You may find a fox exploring a nearby village at night
