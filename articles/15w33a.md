Roar! That’s dragon for “ _Greetings, human. I like your face. Here’s a
snapshot_ ”.

This week’s snapshot brings a whole new type of potion, some smaller changes
to existing potions, more changes to the Dragon fight mechanics (there’s a
reason to respawn her now, and I do not apologize for making it so much
harder), and a bunch of optimisations/bug fixes.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind people that we have not yet
balanced the new (or existing) features. Things will either be completely
overpowered or hilariously underpowered, so keep that in mind when playing
with any new stuff!

Here are some of the notable changes:

  * Added new ‘lingering’ class of potions.
  * Told the dragon that you all called her funny names, so now she’s extra angry.
  * Optimisations! Bug fixes!
  * Looking into End Gateways may cause slight headaches.
  * Recalibrated the quantum intake regulator.

Searge also requested that you all know the following. I suspect he’s
moonlighting as a litter pick.

  * It will be noticed if you throw your trash everywhere
  * It will also be noticed if you pick it up and keep your world clean

And these are some of the fixed bugs:

  * [Bug [MC-82945](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-82945)] - UUID error: Tried to add entity with duplicate UUID spam
  * [Bug [MC-83350](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-83350)] - Entities teleporting through a portal disappear instead of teleporting.
  * [Bug [MC-83731](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-83731)] - Using /kill on the Ender Dragon doesn’t end the fight
  * [Bug [MC-85288](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-85288)] - “Save World” and “Cancel” Button have been switched
  * [Bug [MC-85382](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-85382)] - Attempting to use a spawn egg on a block thats out of range throws error
  * [Bug [MC-85397](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-85397)] - Adult mobs spawned with mob eggs are “invalid”, they can’t be selected with @e
  * [Bug [MC-85542](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-85542)] - Enderdragon can destroy end_portal and end_gateway blocks

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to

fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can select it in the
dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up your world first
or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new profile” dialog).

different folder from your main worlds.**
