# 1.10-pre1
Published on Jun 2, 2016

It is time. Here is ~~this weeks snapshot~~ the first Minecraft 1.10 pre-
release. We will decide when the final Minecraft 1.10 update will be released
based on the feedback we get and the reported issues on our bugtracker.

Reporting bugs on our bugtracker is the best way to tell us about things that
are horribly broken or even crash your game. Please make sure the issue is not
already reported before posting a new ticket.

The bug tracker has a “search” function that will help you to figure out if
there’s already a ticket about the problem you want to report.
