# 15w51a
Published on Dec 17, 2015

**Update:** Snapshot _15w51b_ is now available and fixes a crash in the AI and
pathfinding code.

The snapshots decided to take a vacation to celebrate christmas, but we could
convince them of one last appearance before they disappear for the rest of the
year. But no worries, the developers are also on vacation, so there won’t be
any changes in the game that you could miss.

As a special guest star we have the bug fix for one of our most popular recent
bugs included in this weeks snapshot. The world generator will now no longer
take a coffee break while the player is riding a horse or using a boat. And I
was told that even riding a minecart is on that list.

Notable changes:

  * Fixed many more bugs
  * The glow effect is now 23% better looking
  * Another 12 lines tweaked in the AI code
  * World generation doesn’t stop anymore when players are riding boats, horses, minecarts or ghasts.
