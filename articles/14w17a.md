It’s been a while since the last snapshot, hope you didn’t miss us too much.
We’ve been working a whole bunch on lots of internal rewriting (for plugin
API, to make things easier for ourselves and to make things run so much more
smoothly) but a lot of that isn’t in this version as it’s fairly unstable.

Notable changes:

  * New highly customisable terrain generation! (Create new world -> “World Type: Customized”)
  * New customisable world borders! Check out the /worldborder command.
  * Lots of bug fixes, performance gains and code cleaninguperizing.
  * ???

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can select it in the
dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up your world first
or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new profile” dialog).

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
