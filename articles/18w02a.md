#  Translations

We've changed our translation file format from key=value to json. This means
we can support newlines! The new files look like this: {"thing": "Thing",
"key": "Value", "some.translation": "Text Of Translation"}

We will pull in the latest translations from [the crowdin
project](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft) soon. Remember that you can
help out by translating the game to your native language [over
there](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft)!

#  Command changes

##  /execute

  * facing <x y z> will run the command as though you're facing x y z
  * facing entity <entity> (eyes|feet) will run the command as though you're facing the entity's eyes or feet
  * offset <x y z> has been renamed to positioned x y z
  * positioned as <entity> will change the command position (x y z) but nothing else
  * rotated as <entity> or rotated y x will run the command as though you're rotated in that direction
  * in (overworld|the_end|the_nether) will run the command as though it's in that dimension
  * at <entity> will change the dimension, position and rotation of the command to match that entity
  * (if|unless) score <name> <objective> matches <range> will test for a score in a range (ie 1, 1..5)
  * anchored (feet|eyes) will make the rest of this command use feet or eyes for ^ ^ ^ coordinates or facing commands

##  /teleport

  * /teleport <entity> doesn't allow rotation or facing, will teleport you to the entity
  * /teleport <x y z> doesn't allow rotation or facing, will teleport you to the position
  * /teleport <victim> <entity> doesn't allow rotation or facing, will teleport victim to entity
  * /teleport <victim> <x y z> [yRot xRot] will teleport you to that position with optional rotation
  * /teleport <victim> <x y z> facing [xFacing yFacing zFacing] will teleport you to that position facing another position
  * `/teleport <victim> <x y z> facing entity <entityFacing> feet|eyes
  * Teleporting to an entity in another dimension is now totally allowed. Hurrah!
  * You can also teleport to another dimension using something like /execute in the_nether run teleport 0 64 0

#  Local coordinates (^ ^ ^)

If you use a local coordinate in a command, it comes from your _feet_ by
default. That means that ^ ^ ^ is at the bottom center of your entity, and ^ ^
^10 is where _your feet are looking_ , 10 blocks forwards.

You can change this for a command by changing the "anchor point" in /execute,
like this: /execute anchored eyes. For example, the following command will
place particles _10 blocks forwards where every entity is looking_ , which for
players is the same point where their mouse cursor is: /execute as @e at @s
anchored eyes run particle minecraft:flame ^ ^ ^10 0 0 0 0 1

Want to know exactly what this command does? Let's take a look!

  * /execute as @e makes the following run once for every entity
  * at @s makes the following run at the location of the current entity
  * anchored eyes makes ^ ^ ^ in the following command come from the entities eyes (which means exactly where they're looking)
  * run particle minecraft:flame will spawn the minecraft:flame particle
  * ^ ^ ^10 will make that particle appear 10 blocks forwards of the current position (which is the current entity's eyes)
  * 0 0 0 means we don't want the particle to move around
  * 0 1 means we want exactly 1 particle, with no speed
