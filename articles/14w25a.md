Published on Jun 18, 2014

In a double feature blog post, we’re happy to bring both a new 1.8 snapshot
(14w25b) and another pre-release for 1.7.10!

## 1.7.10 pre-release 4

This pre-release allows you to finally upload your own worlds to Realms and
adds an option to allow you to enable command-blocks on your own Realm. It
also fixes some possible future-compatibility issues we discovered.

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get the pre-release, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button.
Call it “pre-releases”, check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots”, select “1.7.10-pre4” and save. To switch to the normal version,
you can select it in the dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher.
