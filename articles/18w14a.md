Published on 2018-04-04

Happy snapshot day everybody! We've mostly recovered from GDC and are now back
to work, full steam ahead!

#  Changes in 18w14a

  * New item: Phantom Membrane
  * New potion: Potion of Slow Falling
  * Added 4 new advancements
  * New Kelp textures
  * Changed generation rules for kelp and seagrass
  * New Riptide behaviours for tridents
  * Optimized cloud rendering some more

#  Changes in 18w14b

  * New blocks: sea pickles!
  * Renamed coral blocks (See below for details)
  * New coral fan textures
  * Destroying waterlogged blocks will only destroy the block, not the water
  * Fixed a bunch of bugs! (listed below)

##  Phantom Membrane

Very spooky.

  * Elytra now requires Phantom Membrane to be repaired
  * Phantoms now drop Phantom Membrane instead of leather
  * Can be crafted into a super spooky Slow Falling potion

##  Advancements

We're making progress!

  *  **Fishy Business:** Catch a fish
  *  **Tactical fishing:** Catch a fish... without a fishing rod!
  *  **A Throwaway Joke** : Throw a trident at something. Note: throwing away your only weapon is not a good idea.
  *  **Very Very Frightening** : Strike a Villager with lightning
  * More to come!

##  Riptide

Whooosh!

  * No longer compatible with Loyalty or Channeling
  * If riptide won't work (such as being on land, nice and dry) you can't attack with the trident at all
  * Riptide will not throw the trident, but instead launch you forwards with the trident
  * Looks neat!

##  Coral names

Hopefully the last time they get renamed!

  * All full blocks of coral are now called "coral block"
  * Coral plants are now called "coral"
  * "blue" coral is now called "tube" coral
  * "pink" coral is now called "brain" coral
  * "purple" coral is now called "bubble" coral
  * "red" coral is now called "fire" coral
  * "yellow" coral is now called "horn" coral
  * For example, "blue coral" is now "tube coral block"
  * For example, "purple coral plant" is now "bubble coral"

##  Sea Pickles

What to call them? It's really quite a pickle.

  * Generate either by themselves in warm oceans, or with coral
  * Up to 4 pickles can be placed in a block
  * Emits light depending on how many pickles there are per block
  * Can be smelted down into green dye
  * Pickle.
