# 16w35a
Published on Sep 1, 2016

Another week, another snapshot. And another opportunity for me to use that
exact same phrase to introduce it.

We are still focused on fixing bugs in the 1.11 snapshots, but Minecon is
getting closer and we have some new features to show there.

We made text change to bring the Snooper Data description into line with the
updated privacy policy. This refers to the fact that we collect a hashed
identifier for your Minecraft account, so we can get an idea of the size of
our active userbase. Remember you can always opt out!

_Notable changes:_

  * Some bugs have been asked to bother another game
  * Most bugs agreed to move on

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “ _New Profile_ ” button.
Call it “snapshots” and check the box saying “ _Enable experimental
development snapshots_ ” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can
select it in the dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up
your world first or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new
