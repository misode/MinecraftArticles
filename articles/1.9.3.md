# 1.9.3
Published on May 10, 2016

**Update:** Minecraft 1.9.4 removes the incorrect snapshot warning when you
load a world from a previous version in Minecraft 1.9.3.

This update fixes some reported issues and improves overall performance of the
game. We also found some ways to reduce the memory usage, especially on
servers.

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

Notable changes:

  * Improved memory usage of the pathfinder
  * Performance of the chunk cache improved
  * Use less memory for biome caching
  * Several tweaks to the AI
  * Tweaks to the Realms
  * Added /stopsound command
  * Removed herob…. (ok, this is getting old, I know)
