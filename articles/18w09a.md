# 18w09a
Published on 2018-03-01

We're currently battling winter here in the office, but we managed to sneak
out this small snapshot a little later than usual.

#  Changes in 18w09a

  * Added underwater ruins!
  * Added new coral blocks!
  * Phantoms no longer spawn in the end
  * Phantoms despawn in the daytime
  * Optimized particle rendering slightly

##  Underwater ruins

We've ruined the game. Again.

  * Come in many different shapes and sizes!
  * Cold ruins can be found in cold, frozen, ocean biomes - regardless of depth
  * Warm ruins can be found in warm, lukewarm, and deep lukewarm biomes
  * Can generate alone or in a big ruined village
  * You can also sometimes find them slightly underground or slightly above sealevel
  * They can contain mysterious treasures! So mysterious that we haven't even added the real treasure yet.
  * A few more things to come in a future snapshot...

##  Coral

Pretty blocks! Or should they be mobs? I'm not entirely sure.

  * Comes in 5 colors: blue, pink, purple, red, yellow
  * Requires water to stay alive
  * If it dies, it dies. Sorry.
  * Currently only obtainable in the creative inventory
  * World generation to come in a future snapshot...
