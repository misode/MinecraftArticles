# 16w33a
Published on Aug 17, 2016

Oh happy day it’s Snapshot Time! We are releasing a new snapshot with several
bug fixes, internal changes and probably also some new bugs. It would be
amazing if you want to report any non-reported bugs you find in our bug
tracker! Many thanks!

While we plan to keep larger new features as a surprise to reveal at Minecon,
some of the smaller changes will make it into snapshots in the following next
weeks. And this snapshot has…

_Notable changes:_

  * Shields will now keep enchantment level and durability when crafted with banners
  * Added an infinite loop
  * Added some more subtitles
  * More things will burn in the furnace (we don’t recommend wool as your main fuel though, and don’t even want to mention carpets…)
  * We have not lowered the range for using beds (we did add a proper error message though :) )
  * Fixed some crashes
  * Removed the infinite loop again, it took too long to finish
