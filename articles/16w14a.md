# 16w14a
Published on Apr 7, 2016

While we have started working on it, there won’t be any snapshots for
Minecraft 1.10 for at least another 2-3 weeks. This snapshot is for Minecraft
1.9.x and will eventually lead to a 1.9.3 pre-release.

**TL;DR: this snapshot is for 1.9.x and not for 1.10**

Notable changes:

  * Introduces some new bugs
  * Fixed some existing bugs
  * Removed the new bugs again

Bugs fixed in 16w14a:

  * [Bug [MC-100382](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-100382)] - Pathfinding Memory Leak

Please report any and all bugs you find in Minecraft to
[bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com). If nobody reports a bug, we can’t
fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “ _New Profile_ ” button.
Call it “snapshots” and check the box saying “ _Enable experimental
development snapshots_ ” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can
select it in the dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up
your world first or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new
profile” dialog).

**Snapshots can corrupt your world, please backup and/or run them in a
different folder from your main worlds.**
