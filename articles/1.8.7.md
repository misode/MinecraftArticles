# 1.8.7
Published on Jun 5, 2015

We have released a new version of Minecraft 1.8, 1.8.7, which is now available
for download in your launcher. This release fixes a few reported security
issues.

This version is fully compatible with all previous 1.8 versions, but it is
still highly recommend to update to 1.8.7 as soon as possible for both players
and servers.

Notable fixes:

  * [Bug [MC-80749](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-80749)] - Resource packs do not get cleaned up
  * [Bug [MC-80750](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-80750)] - Resource packs continue downloading after disconnect
  * [Bug [MC-80875](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-80875)] - Specific unicode character pair crashes tr_TR clients
  * [Bug [MC-81001](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81001)] - Signs can cause crashes
