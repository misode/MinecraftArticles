# 1.8.8
Published on Jul 27, 2015

We have released a new version of Minecraft, 1.8.8, to improve some
functionality of Realms and fix some reported bugs & crashes.

This version is fully compatible with all previous 1.8 versions, but it is
still highly recommend to update to 1.8.8 as soon as possible for both players
and servers.

Notable bugs fixed:

  * [Bug [MC-80817](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-80817)] - Server may not start in some environments
  * [Bug [MC-81018](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81018)] - Potential server crashing exploit
  * [Bug [MC-81405](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81405)] - Client crashing exploit
  * [Bug [MC-82629](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-82629)] - Lag exploit with banners
