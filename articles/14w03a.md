Snapshot time! We’ve fixed a whole bunch of bugs introduced in last weeks
snapshots, introduced a few new commands and tweaked a few things that needed
tweaking.

Notable additions for mapmakers:

  * /tp now supports rotation arguments
  * Player selectors (@p, @e, etc) now support cubic areas. For example: @e[x=0,y=0,z=0,dx=10,dy=10,dz=10] gets all entities between 0,0,0 and 10,10,10
  * Added /clone command to copy large areas to other areas
  * Added a /fill command to fill a large area with a block

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “New Profile” button. Call
it “snapshots” and check the box saying “Enable experimental development
snapshots” and save. To switch to the normal version, you can select it in the
dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher.
