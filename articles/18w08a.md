This week's snapshot is mostly to help prepare for a really cool snapshot
coming your way soon. That's right - it's a snapshot snapshot!

#  Changes in 18w08b

  * Added actual fish!
  * The game shouldn't crash when joining multiplayer! Again!
  * Changed natural water visibility
  * Removed water visibility part of the Water Breathing potion & Respiration enchantment
  * Warm and lukewarm oceans now have sand floors
  * Added recipes to turn dried kelp into storage blocks and back again
  * Removed deep warm ocean biomes, warm oceans can only be shallow now
  * Added new fish item icons!

##  Ocean biomes

We didn't want to stop at seven seas.

  * Oceans are now split into 5 temperatures: frozen, cold, normal, lukewarm, warm
  * Each ocean (except for warm) has a deep variant, like before
  * World generation should stay the same, but old chunks will only have normal oceans

##  Underwater caves & ravines

They look so cool. Sea for yourself!

  * Caves under the ocean are 50% more humid
  * Ravines will appear in all oceans
  * Some ocean ravines cut deep, exposing lava to the seas

##  Swimming fish

Adding features on a thursday? That's fishy.

  * There are currently 3 types of fish: cod, salmon, puffer fish
  * Cod will spawn in moderate oceans (cold/normal/lukewarm)
  * Salmon will spawn in frozen/cold oceans and rivers
  * Puffer fish will spawn in lukewarm/warm oceans
  * Fish need water to live. Life pro tip!
  * Cod and salmon are very social and prefer to swim in groups
  * You can catch fish with a water bucket, but be kind to them!
  * Fish aren't complete yet, we have more changes coming soon!

##  Water visibility

I can see clearly now, the water's gone!

  * Respiration & Water Breathing will no longer directly change your visibility underwater
  * You can see better the longer you stay underwater
  * If you go back out of water, you'll quickly lose your water vision
