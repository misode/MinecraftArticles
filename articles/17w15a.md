# 17w15a
Published on 2017-04-12

It's almost easter, so we've hidden a snapshot in the launcher! It's not very
well hidden, admittedly, it's right there for you to just hit "play". We
tried. <3

### Changes in snapshot 17w15a

  * Added descriptions to advancements & changed some titles. It's not entirely final, but we're getting there!
  * Added colored beds! You can craft them with coloured wool or dying a white bed
  * Players shouldn't be getting kicked from servers randomly now, and both recipe book & advancements should work fine in multiplayer

  * Added a toast notification for toggling the narrator
  * Added the option to toggle narrator between: off, chat & system, chat only, system messages only
  * Made stairs a little more solid, allowing torches, fences, glass panes, walls & snow to connect to them properly
