Published on 2018-11-23

Todays snapshot is nice and peaceful. We've gone and fixed some bugs, cleaned
up so much code, nothing can go wr███████████████ ...

Oh no...

 **UPDATE:** We fixed some more things! Enjoy the snapshot and have a great
weekend!

#  Changes in 18w47b

  * Numerous worldgen performance improvements
  * Adjusted mob spawning behavior to be closer to that of 1.13.2
  * More Jappa texture changes
  * Fixed strongholds not generating properly
  * Reduced the cluster size of Pillager spawning so Outposts aren't flooded by Pillagers

#  Changes in 18w47a

  * Added Pillager Outpost
  * Added Raids
  * Changed some block textures based on feedback

##  Pillager Outpost

  * As if finding Pillagers out in the wild wasn't scary enough with Patrols, keep an eye out as out on your exploration you may just find an outpost of theirs.
  * Can be found in any biome a village can be generated.
  * Takes advantage of our new mystery block, the Jigsaw, for generation.

##  Raids

  * If you find an illager wearing a banner on its head, be careful not to kill it!
  * If you do kill it, you might find yourself facing a Bad Omen
  * If you find yourself facing a Bad Omen, be _especially_ careful not to walk into a village
  * If you do walk into a village...good luck
