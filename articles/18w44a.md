# 18w44a
Published on 2018-10-31

It's a very spooky day today, zombies everywhere, bats flapping around... It
must be october 31st, Halloween! Man, can you imagine if it were also friday
the 13th? That'd be truly scary.

Here at Mojang, we celebrate halloween in style: with snapshots! And this
weeks snapshot is another doozy! New cats! New blocks! Lots of new blocks!

Keeping in the spooky theme of the day, though, we've not added any new
functionality to the new blocks contained within this snapshot. How fiendish
of the developers! What could they possibly be for? We may never find out...
At least not today.

#  Changes in 18w44a

  * Split cats and ocelots to their own creatures and updated cats with new features!
  * Added lots of new blocks!
  * You can now right click on signs with dyes to change the text color
  * Lots of performance improvements, especially to client stuttering!
  * Added "Programmer Art" in the resource pack menu: it's the old textures, easy to use!

##  Cat and ocelot split

  * Stray cats can be tamed
  * Tamed cats can give lovely (or less lovely) morning gifts to their owners
  * Ocelots can't be tamed, but they might start trusting you if you feed them with fish
  * Phantoms are terribly scared of cats - how convenient!
  * Cat collars can now be dyed
  * Added several new cat skins!

##  New blocks

Even more! Can you believe it?!

All of these blocks currently have no functionality and are only available in
the creative inventory. This will change really soon, we just wanted to get
the actual blocks themselves out there as soon as we could! They might also
change visually, too!

  * Added Barrel
  * Added Smoker
  * Added Blast Furnace
  * Added Cartography Table
  * Added Fletching Table
  * Added Grindstone
  * Added Lectern
  * Added Smithing Table
  * Added Stonecutter
  * Added Bell

#  Technical changes in 18w44a

  * Players, armor stands and wither now have loot tables
  * Changed NBT chat components
  * Removed award part of /drop command (loot now does the same thing)

##  NBT chat component

  * Block variant {"nbt": <path>, "block":"<coordinates>"}, where <coordinates> field uses same format as /setblock
  * Entity variant {"nbt": <path>, "entity":<selector>}, where selector field uses same format as /kill
  * Additionaly, if field interpret is present and set to true, contents of selected tags will be interpreted as chat components
  * Works same as selector components:
    * if there are no elements, returns empty string
    * if there are multiple elements, merges them with , 

##  Loot tables

  * New loot table functions: set_lore, fill_player_head
  * Removed loot table condition: entity_present
  * New loot table conditions: damage_source_properties, location_check, weather_check and two special modifiers: inverted and alternative
  * Renamed entity parameter in predicates from direct_killer_entity to direct_killer

###  Modified conditions

####  entity_properties

Now uses same predicate syntax as advancements (like player_killed_entity).
Parameters are now described in predicate field. Now uses same predicate
syntax as advancements (like player_killed_entity). Parameters are now
described in predicate field. If this field is empty object, any entity is
accepted (but still has to be present).

###  Modified functions

####  set_name

Added new parameter entity (same values as entity_present condition). If
present, name will be resolved with that entity (allows using selector and
score components).

###  New functions

####  fill_player_head

Copies player profile info to player head item.

#####  Parameters

  * entity \- source of profile (same values as entity_present condition, will do nothing if it's not player).
