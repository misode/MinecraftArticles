# 1.16.5
Published on 2021-01-15

Happy Friday! We're now releasing 1.16.5, which fixes two critical stability
issues. We are not releasing more information about these issues at this time
to protect servers that have not yet updated.

This release is network compatible with 1.16.4 - this means you do not need to
upgrade your game right away to play on an upgraded server. However, we highly
encourage all server owners to update as soon as possible to apply the
stability fixes.

Next week, we aim to release the next snapshot of Caves & Cliffs. Stay tuned!
