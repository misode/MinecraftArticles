# /DATAPACK

  * New command to control loaded data packs
  * Has the following subcommands:
  * enable <name> \- will enable the specific pack
  * disable <name> \- will disable the specific pack
  * list [available|enabled] \- will list all data packs, or only the available/enabled ones
  * Data packs are enabled by default, but if you disable it you can reenable it with these commands:
  * enable <name> \- will enable the specific pack, putting it in its default position
  * enable <name> first - will enable the specific pack, putting it before any other pack (lowest priority)
  * enable <name> last - will enable the specific pack, putting it after any other pack (highest priority)
  * enable <name> before <existing> \- will enable the specific pack, putting it before (lower priority) <existing> pack
  * enable <name> after <existing> \- will enable the specific pack, putting it after (higher priority) <existing> pack
