# 1.13
Published on 2018-07-22

The tide is coming in at last! That's sea-faring speak for 'Java Players!
Today you get the full Update Aquatic!'

There's a whole new ocean of features, impatiently waiting for you to dive in!
Take a delightful swim with dolphins and tropical fish. Explore mysterious
ruins and tragic shipwrecks while hunting for new deep-sea treasures. Meet
turtles on the shore and defend their eggs from mobs with the new trident!

Trust us, you'll want that new weapon. Because our biggest ocean update ever
has also made these seas much more dangerous places to explore. Get too
distracted by the colourful coral, and you might get dragged down to the ocean
floor by bubble columns. Which could result in introducing yourself to the
Drowned. What are the Drowned? Why not swim down to the ocean floor and find
out? After you!

Still, at least you're safe on land! Well, as long as you get enough sleep.
Otherwise, you might meet The Phantom, the mob you voted into Minecraft last
year. Be careful what you wish for, and enjoy the update!
