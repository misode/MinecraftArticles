# 16w21a
Published on May 25, 2016

**UPDATE: Minecraft snapshot 16w21b is now available**

Last week the polar bears were released into the world. This week they can
enjoy their peaceful life in a world with less bugs.

Some of the changes and new features are not 100% finalized and we are going
to improve and balance them in the upcoming snapshots.

Most noticeable is the lack of sound effects for some of the new things in the
game. There is no need to report them as bugs as we are fully aware of the
issue and our sound magicians are already working on it.

Reporting bugs on our bugtracker is the best way to tell us about things that
are horribly broken or even crash your game. Please make sure the issue is not
already reported before posting a new ticket.

The bug tracker has a “search” function that will help you to figure out if
there’s already a ticket about the problem you want to report.

Notable changes:

  * Bugs fixed
  * More bugs fixed
  * Removed some broken code
  * Solved some reported issues
  * Changed some incorrect things in the game
  * Even more bugs fixed

fix it!

To get snapshots, open your launcher and press the “ _New Profile_ ” button.
Call it “snapshots” and check the box saying “ _Enable experimental

select it in the dropdown at the bottom left corner of the launcher. Back up
your world first or run the game on in a different folder (See the “new
