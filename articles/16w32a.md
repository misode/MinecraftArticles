# 16w32a
Published on Aug 10, 2016

**Update: Minecraft snapshot 16w32b has been released!**

Snapshot time! What you all have been waiting for is finally happening. We are
releasing a new snapshot with all the latest internal changes, improvements,
bug fixes and some new bugs.

Some of the internal changes are quite complex. If you encounter any problems
that don’t have a bug report on our bug tracker already, please make sure to
report them and help us improve the game in the next snapshots.

While we plan to keep larger new features as a surprise to reveal at Minecon,
some of the smaller changes will make it into snapshots in the following next
weeks. And this snapshot has…

_Notable changes:_

  * Some mobs are now more afraid to get wet in the water
  * There are now more spawn eggs for many different mobs and this time they are working properly, so we’ll keep them
  * Mob types are now separated like this: 
    * Guardian and Elder Guardian
    * Skeleton, Stray and Wither Skeleton
    * Zombie, Zombie Villager and Husk
    * Horse, Skeleton Horse, Zombie Horse, Mule and Donkey
  * Changed the duration of hunger and saturation effects
  * Broke some bugs so they should not happen anymore
  * Resource pack format changed slightly, it’s now using version 3 
    * Version 3 resource packs have to use lowercase filenames for everything
  * Most commands can now use blockstate definitions instead of a numerical metadata value
  * Snowmen are now 10% less derpy
  * More robust handling of invalid items and hopefully less duping bugs due to this change
  * Lightning storm will now attract less skeleton horses
